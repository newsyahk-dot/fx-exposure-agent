# fx-exposure-agent — project rules

Entry for the **PayPal AI Hackathon** (Devpost). Submission deadline: Nov 12, 2026 12:00 PT (Nov 13 05:00 KST).
Plan (Korean): newsyahk-dot/fx-wiki `docs/contests/2026-10-20-PayPal-AI-해커톤-기획.md`.

## What it is
For solo sellers and freelancers paid in several currencies through PayPal invoices: show how much of the
money still owed is exposed to FX moves, by currency and by week, and let an AI agent carry out PayPal
actions that shorten that exposure (payment reminders, early-payment discount terms) **after the user approves**.

## Rules
- **Sandbox only.** Never call PayPal live endpoints, never move real money.
- **No secrets in the repo.** This repo is public. Keys live in `.env.local` (git-ignored) or Vercel env vars.
  Names: `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`, `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET`, `FXA_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (app-only key; not `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
  which collides with Claude Code's own login). Never print their values. The Anthropic client pins
  `baseURL` to api.anthropic.com so an environment `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` can never redirect the key.
- **No FX direction calls.** Shocks are symmetric (±3%). The 1-sigma swing is a size of uncertainty, not an
  expected loss. The app shows costs and swings side by side and never says which choice is better.
- **Nothing silently dropped.** Invoices that cannot be valued go to `skipped` with a reason.
- **Rates source:** ECB euro reference rates via Frankfurter, EUR base crossed into KRW (`src/lib/fx.ts`).
  Do not query `base=KRW` — it returns rounded quotes (0.7% error, measured 2026-10-23). Show the source on screen.
- **Every agent action needs an explicit approve click.** The model proposes; the user decides.
- **Model text is gated** (`src/lib/explain.ts`): every number must come from the facts we pass, and forecast/advice
  wording is rejected; failures fall back to a fixed template and the reason is shown. Model: `FXA_EXPLAIN_MODEL`
  (default claude-haiku-5-5, effort low), one call per book state, cached for days; the demo snapshot stores them.
- UI, README and demo video are in **English** (judges). Code comments in English.
- Run `npm test` before every push.
